## Overview

This repository contains the notebook `model.ipynb`, which includes:

- **Implementation:** Code for various machine learning and deep learning models.
- **Experiments:** Analysis and testing of models on different datasets.
- **Learning:** Step-by-step explanations of concepts and techniques.

This project is a work in progress, reflecting my ongoing education and practice in this field.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.12 or above
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HaiderYar/MNIST_classification_using_neural_network.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd MNIST_classification_using_neural_network
    ```

3. **Install required packages:**
    Install the necessary Python packages as per the instructions in the model.ipynb notebook. Typically, you can use:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the notebook:**
    Since it is a jupyter notebook so you can run individual cells when opened on vscode or jupyter lab
